# Dropzone 3 Actions

This repository contains a bunch of useful add-on actions that work with Dropzone 3. To install them you can clone this repository and double click on bundles to add them.

This repository works in conjunction with the [dropzone3-actions-zipped](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions-zipped) repository which contains zipped versions of these actions (auto updated nightly). The zipped versions are better if you want to download only specific actions or need to provide a link to an action.


## Dropzone 3 API

There have been big changes to the Dropzone API since Dropzone 2. Actions listed in here will only work with Dropzone 3. Dropzone 2 actions (.dropzone files) can still be added to Dropzone 3 but it's best if you download and use the Bundle Script.dzbundle action from this repository to convert old Dropzone 2 scripts into shiny new Dropzone 3 action bundles.

A Dropzone 3 action bundle is simply a directory with a .dzbundle extension. It must contain an action.rb script and an icon.png file that contains the icon for the action. The bundle can also optionally contain other resources such as ruby libraries or executables. The action.rb file must have certain metadata at the top. Dropzone parses this metadata when you add the action. 

Here's an example of correct metadata you can copy/paste and use for your own actions:

```
# Dropzone Action Info
# Name: Example Action
# Description: This text describes what your action does. 
# Handles: Files
# Events: Dragged
# Creator: Aptonic Software
# URL: http://aptonic.com
# RunsSandboxed: Yes
# Version: 1.0
# MinDropzoneVersion: 3.0
```

The meta data block must begin with the line ```# Dropzone Action Info``` and be the first thing at the top of the file.

Each recognised meta data option is described below:

<table>
	<th>
		Field
	</th>
	<th>
		Explanation
	</th>
	<th>
		Required
	</th>
	<tr>
		<td>Name</td>
		<td>Provides the name for your action.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Description</td>
		<td>Describes what your action does.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Handles</td>
		<td>Can be either "Files" or "Text" or "Files, Text" to handle both files and text.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Events</td>
		<td>Can be either "Dragged" or "Clicked" or "Dragged, Clicked" to handle both clicks and drags.<br/>
			If not specified then defaults to handling both clicks and drags.</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Creator</td>
		<td>Your name or company which will be shown when adding the action.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>URL</td>
		<td>Your URL which will be shown and linked to when adding the action.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>OptionsNIB</td>
		<td>A optional configuration panel that can be shown when adding the action to collect needed info such as a username, password or API key<br/>
			Currently available OptionsNIBs are: Login, ExtendedLogin, APIKey, UsernameAPIKey, ChooseFolder and ChooseApplication<br/>
			See the OptionsNIBs section further down for an explanation of how to use these.</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>SkipConfig</td>
		<td>If your action doesn't use an OptionsNIB then it's best to set this to Yes. It makes your action get added directly to the grid without showing the configuration panel first. The configuration panel is shown by default if this option is not specified.</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>RunsSandboxed</td>
		<td>If your action does things that are incompatible with OS X sandboxing (such as running AppleScript or writing to arbitrary directories) then set this to No. Users of the non-Mac App Store version of Dropzone 3 will be able to run your action as normal but users of the Mac App Store version of Dropzone 3 will be prompted to install a special helper app that runs your action unsandboxed on behalf of the parent app.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Version</td>
		<td>The version number of your action. Dropzone uses this to see if a newer version of your action is available and if it is then it prompts the user to upgrade. Increment this before sending a pull request to this repository with your latest action.</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>MinDropzoneVersion</td>
		<td>As Dropzone gets updated new API and features will be added so you may need to specify a minimum compatible version of Dropzone that your action works with. The user will be prompted to update Dropzone if they are using a version behind what your action supports. You can leave this out or set it to 3.0 initially.</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeyModifiers</td>
		<td>A comma separated list of key modifiers your action supports. When the user drags a file onto your action they can hold a particular modifier key including Command, Option, Control or Shift. The held modifier will be passed to your script in the ENV['KEY_MODIFIERS'] variable and you can modify the behaviour of your action based on the held key. A example of valid values for this field would be "Option" or "Command, Option, Control, Shift" (without quotes).</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>LoginTitle</td>
		<td>The Login, APIKey and UsernameAPIKey OptionsNIBs allow you to specify an optional title above the fields. You can provide a string for this such as "Service Login Details". If not specified then it defaults to 'Login Details'</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>UseSelectedItemNameAndIcon</td>
		<td>If your action uses the ChooseFolder OptionsNIB then this specifies whether you want the label and icon to be set to the chosen folders after selecting the folder. Defaults to No.</td>
		<td>No</td>
	</tr>
