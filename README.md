# Dropzone 3 Actions

This repository contains a bunch of useful add-on actions that work with Dropzone 3. To install them you can clone this repository and double click on bundles to add them.

There repository works in conjunction with the [dropzone3-actions-zipped](https://github.com/aptonic/dropzone3-actions-zipped) repository which contains zipped versions of these actions (auto updated nightly). The zipped versions are better if you want to download only specific actions or need to provide a link to an action.


## Dropzone 3 API

There have been big changes to the Dropzone API since Dropzone 2. Actions listed in here will only work with Dropzone 3. Dropzone 2 actions (.dropzone files) can still be added to Dropzone 3 but it's best if you download and use the Bundle Script.dzbundle action from this repository to convert old Dropzone 2 scripts into shiny new Dropzone 3 action bundles.
